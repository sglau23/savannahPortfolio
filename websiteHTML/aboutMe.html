        <p>My name is Savannah Lau, and I am a second year studying Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am born and raised in Chicago, IL.  What interests me the most about coding is its uncanny ability for it to be applied to anything! Coding can give something life and even redefine a productâ€™s original purpose, which I find truly beautiful.  </p>
